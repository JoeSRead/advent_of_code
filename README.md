# advent_of_code
My Advent of Code work (starting in properly in 2020) https://adventofcode.com/

This repo contains my solutions to the advent of code puzzles. Each day there are two puzzles to solve so I will hopefully be updating this daily while the challenge is running (December). 


Any notebook from before 2020 represents practice work as I dip into the old puzzles for practice!
